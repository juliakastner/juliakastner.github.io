# Activities

## Scientific Service
I was/am a member of the Program Committees of  [Eurocrypt 2025](https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2025/), [ProTeCS 2025](https://protecs-workshop.gitlab.io/), and [Asiacrypt 2025](https://asiacrypt.iacr.org/2025/).

I have been a reviewer for Designs, Codes and Cryptography.

I have subreviewed for Crypto 2025, Eurocrypt 2024, PKC 2023, and TCC 2022.
