Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Cryptology Group](https://www.cwi.nl/en/groups/cryptology/) at CWI. 
Before that, I was a member of the  [Foundations of Cryptography Group](https://foc.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich where I graduated from my Doctoral Studies under the supervision of [Dennis Hofheinz](kjdf.de). 
Before that, I completed my BSc and MSc degrees in computer science at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu).

My current research focuses on advanced digital signatures such as blind signatures and anonymous credentials, as well as investigating lower bounds and impossibility results for various types of schemes.
