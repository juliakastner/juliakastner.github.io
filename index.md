Before that, I was a member of the  [Foundations of Cryptography Group](https://foc.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich where I graduated from my Doctoral Studies under the supervision of [Dennis Hofheinz](kjdf.de). 
Before that, I completed my BSc and MSc degrees in computer science at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu)
