## Bouldering
I enjoy going bouldering and am usually up for exploring the local bouldering gym or outdoor spot during a free afternoon or after a conference. If you want to go bouldering together or want to be added to the bouldering at crypto confrerences signal group, let me know! 

Here's some pictures from my outdoor bouldering adventures:

## Squirrels
I am a big fan of squirrels. If you see one, tell me!

I have the (not entirely serious) theory that squirrels are interested in cryptography. I provide some anecdotal evidence of this below:
